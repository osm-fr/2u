# 2u

A rendering project using OpenStreetMap data based on the work of Andy Allan* to convert the osm.org style to CartoCSS

2u stands for "Ugly and Usefull", unlike the "defaut osm.org" style made for about every uses, this one focuses on Openstreetmap contributors. Every thing approved 
on the wiki and significantly used is meant to be shown on this style, not matter how ugly, the goal is to show them. (Unless there are conflicts with other tags)
