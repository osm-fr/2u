This benchs.sh script provides a set of benchmark zones to generate image
from the 2u styles and check if a patch works and does or doesn't increase the
rendering time compared to before.

This sure could be much better, less dependent on the data, but that a lot
of work !

It uses nik2img.py (and that program should be in you path)

To run it :
./benchs.sh <xml style> <generated images directory>
